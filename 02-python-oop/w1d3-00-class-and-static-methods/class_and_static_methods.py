"""
Instance Attributes and Instance Methods

Up to now we've been creating instance attributes and instance
methods.

Instance attributes are unique to each instance of a class and
are defined in the __init__ constructor method.

Instance methods are methods that belong to an object
of the class, rather than the class itself.
"""


"""
Class Attributes and Class Methods

Class Attributes are shared among all instances of the class
and are defined outside of any method in the class definition.

These class attributes are also known as static class attributes
or static class variables.
"""


"""
Static Methods
Static methods are similar to class methods, the difference being
that a static method is bound only to the class, while a class
method is bound to the class and shared amongst all instances of
that class.

This means that a static method can be called without
an object for that class.

This also means that static methods cannot modify the state of an
object as they are not bound to it.
