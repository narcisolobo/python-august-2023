# Flask Routing and View Functions

Flask is a web application framework for Python that follows the concept of routing and view functions. These two components play a crucial role in defining the behavior and structure of your web application.

## Routing:
Routing refers to the process of mapping URLs to specific functions in your Flask application. It determines how different URLs will be handled and which code will execute when a particular URL is accessed.

### Decorators `@app.route()`
In Flask, routing is achieved through the use of decorators, specifically the `@app.route()` decorator.

#### Static routing
```py
@app.route("/home")
def home():
  return "This is the home view."
```
#### Dynamic routing with route parameters
```py
@app.route("/projects/<int:project_id>")
def home(project_id):
  return f"Viewing project {project_id}."
```

### View Functions:
View functions are Python functions that are associated with specific routes. When a user requests a particular URL, Flask calls the corresponding view function to handle the request and generate the response. View functions define what content is displayed or what actions are performed when a specific URL is accessed.
