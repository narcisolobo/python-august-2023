# Intro to Relational Databases
Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes and stores data in a tabular form, consisting of rows and columns. The foundation of relational databases is based on the relational model, which defines relationships between tables using keys and constraints. These databases are designed to efficiently manage large amounts of structured data and provide powerful mechanisms for querying, manipulating, and retrieving data.

The purpose of relational databases is to provide a reliable, scalable, and flexible solution for storing and managing data. They offer a structured approach to organizing data by breaking it down into logical entities (tables) and defining relationships between them. This enables the representation of complex real-world scenarios and allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation operations.
